# CodeReuse
Codereuse Class Documentation
Purpose:
The Codereuse class contains three nested classes, each demonstrating a different example of code reuse through methods. The classes include:

SortingExample: Illustrates a method for sorting an array in descending order.
StatisticsExample: Demonstrates methods for calculating various statistical measures from an array.
MatrixMultiplicationExample: Provides a method for multiplying two matrices.
SortingExample Class:
Purpose:
The purpose of this class is to showcase code reuse through a method that sorts an integer array in descending order.

Methods:
sortDescending(int[] arr):
Input Parameters: An array of integers (arr) that needs to be sorted.
Output/Return: The method does not return any value, but it sorts the input array in descending order.                   StatisticsExample Class:
Purpose:
This class demonstrates code reuse through methods to calculate various statistical measures from an integer array.

Methods:
calculateStatistics(int[] data):
Input Parameters: An array of integers (data) for which statistical measures need to be calculated.
Output/Return: An array of doubles containing the median, variance, standard deviation, and sum of squares.                                                                                                                                                                      MatrixMultiplicationExample Class:
Purpose:
This class showcases code reuse through a method for multiplying two matrices.

Methods:
matrixMultiplication(int[][] matrixA, int[][] matrixB, int rowsA, int columnsA, int columnsB):
Input Parameters:
matrixA: First matrix (2D array).
matrixB: Second matrix (2D array).
rowsA: Number of rows in the first matrix.
columnsA: Number of columns in the first matrix (should be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix).
columnsB: Number of columns in the second matrix.
Output/Return: The product matrix (2D array) resulting from the multiplication of matrixA and matrixB.
